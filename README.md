# Inside Team
Inside Team is a front-end based web application where you can find some top level football clubs from English Premire League.
You'll see twenty teams on the home page. All teams will have a team logo and team's name. Also you will see a explore button to know more about the club. The explore button will take you another page where you will see some other information about that particular clubs.

The Technologies I have used here are: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React, React router, FontAwesome and a API from the SportsDB for fetch the data.
